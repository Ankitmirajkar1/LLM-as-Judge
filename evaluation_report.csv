Within how many days must a return request be made after delivery of the product?,This is my RAG app response,8,"{'correctness/accuracy': 'Matches the ground truth in terms of the time duration (10 days)', 'relevance': 'Directly answers the question asked', 'completeness': ""The answer is missing a specific format that would indicate it's a 'return request window', making it slightly incomplete"", 'faithfulness': 'Does not directly quote the ground truth, so there may be a slight bias in the answer'}"
What happens if you cancel an order after it has been shipped?,This is my RAG app response,2,"Incorrect information about cancellation and order status. Ground truth specifies 'Return with all applicable fees', but Actual Answer does not mention cancellation, shipping or return details."
How many days after a refund is processed can the funds become available in the customer's account?,This is my RAG app response,8,"The actual answer accurately represents the ground truth, with only a minor difference in wording ('2‑10 days from the date of refund processing' vs. '2 days after a refund is processed can the funds become available in the customer's account'). Accuracy, relevance, completeness, and faithfulness are maintained."
"If you cancel an order 9 days after placing it, what percentage of the total amount will be deducted as a cancellation charge?",This is my RAG app response,2,"The actual answer does not provide a direct match or mention of a 9% cancellation charge, making it slightly relevant but not accurate or complete in addressing the question."
"To which email address should a customer send a request for a refund, replacement, or return?",This is my RAG app response,8,"{'correctness': ""The actual answer provided matches the ground truth email address. However, it lacks the additional information regarding checking the seller's profile for the correct email."", 'relevance': 'The actual answer directly addresses the question and provides a specific email address to contact.', 'completeness': ""Lacks additional information about checking the seller's profile."", 'faithfulness': 'Provides the correct email address as stated in the ground truth.'}"
